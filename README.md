# Introduction

This is a Personal Portfolio Website

## Inside this Website

I have added about myself, my pictures. my projects, some testimonials and a footer bar including a copyright message. I have tried to use HTML, CSS to make this website. As well as copyright free elements to setup this website. There are some icons which is used.




# Usage
I have made a link of GitHub pages where it should be found. But this is not a responsive website so that you can not preview this in all devices.
